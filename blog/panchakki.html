Hazrat Baba Shah Musafir built Panchakki, a water mill, in 1734. Situated in the vibrant city of Aurangabad, Nehar-e-Panchakki was used to grind grains for the pilgrims. It is essentially a grinding mill that works on water mechanism. The entire structure of Panchakki primarily consists of a court, a madrasa, the house of a minister, a mosque, houses dedicated to females and a sarai. This is a very popular and frequently visited spot in Aurangabad. Surrounded in hues of blue and shades of green, this attraction acts like a perfect picnic spot for a family and an outing with friends.

An underground water stream 6 km away from Panchakki, which is a tributary of Harsul River is a source of steady water supply to this structure and is transported through earthen pipes. One can only imagine the pure genius and farsightedness of the construction plan of this marvel.

What is noteworthy is that even though the purpose of the building this structure was sheer utility, the beauty of it is not compromised in the least. The calm silver waters of the reservoir act like the sky's mirror and the gentle rhythmic ripples hypnotise the onlooker. There is a huge banyan tree, almost 300 years old, which stands tall by this marvel, only to add to its brimming magnificence.<br>
