<p>Considered a paradise very close to the city, Mhaismal is a gorgeous hill station. It is one of the attractions not exploited as much as the other commercial hill stations in India. With less crowd and lush greenery all around, this tranquil place is a beautiful respite for nature lovers. It is also a favourite bird watching and picnic destination.<br>

	LOCATION:  Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India<br>
