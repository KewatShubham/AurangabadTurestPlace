<p>Located 15 km away from the main city of Aurangabad, Daulatabad Fort is an ancient fortification that rises formidably from the midst of verdant greenery. Often hailed as one of the 'seven wonders of Maharashtra', this architectural marvel is believed to have been built in the 12th century. Perhaps the most enchanting qualities of the Daulatabad Fort is its location, from the zenith of which you can capture a mesmerising view of the entire city. You need to hike some 750 odd steps up to the top, but the view down below is a wonderful thing to behold<br>

	LOCATION:  Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India<br>
