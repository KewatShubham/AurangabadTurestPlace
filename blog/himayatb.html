<p>Himayat Bagh is a mesmerising 400-acre garden built in the 17th century during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Amidst the lush green lawns, Himayat Bagh houses a pool and a stunning nursery where one can find a variety of flora. The garden is now also a part of Marathwada University and has a Fruit Research Station.
