	<ul><p>Naukhanda Palace was built in 1616 by Malik Ambar and had massive gateways leading to it. The magnificent palace has nine apartments, masjid, hot baths, kacheri in addition to several other structures.<br>
<br>


The palace had nine apartments, the interior buildings consisted of five zananas, a Divan i Aam, a Divan i Khas, a masjid and a kacheri, each provided with a garden and a cistern. The walls of the central part of the Devankhana, and a hamam or hot bath attached to the building, are in a fair state of preservation. However, the wood-work and the stucco plaster are all gone. The Divan i Aam is a large quadrangular structure much in ruins. The Kacheri close by contains a gadi of the Nizam. In the throne room are placed the original paraphernalia.
<br>
<br>
The Diwan e Aam was demolished when the present medical college of Aurangabad was constructed. The palace now houses The Aurangabad College for women. In the olden days Nawab Salar Jang's palace and Govind Baksh's mahal were between the Paitan and Jafar gates.

Presently owned by Prince Mukarram Jah Bahadur.
