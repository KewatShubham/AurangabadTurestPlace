<p>Bani Begum Garden is a panoramic garden located 24 km from Aurangabad. The garden is known for its lush green surroundings and comfortable atmosphere. The garden got its name from the tomb of Bani Begum, wife of Aurangzeb's son, which is found in middle of this garden. Fountains, fluted pillars and massive domes can be seen in the garden and is landscaped in the Mughal style and presents with architecture of the departed period.
