    &nbsp Khadki was the original name of the village which was made a capital city by Malik Ambar.<br> The Prime Minister of Murtaza Nizam, Shah of Ahmadnagar. Within a decade, Khadki grew into a populous and imposing city. Malik Ambar died in 1626.<br> He was succeeded by his son Fateh Khan, who changed the name of Khadki to Fatehnagar. <br> With the capture of Daulatabad by the imperial troops in 1633, the Nizam Shahi dominions,<br>including Fatehnagar, came under the possession of the Moghals.
   <br>
In 1653 when Mughal prince Aurangzeb was appointed the viceroy of the Deccan for the second time, <br> he made Fatehnagar his capital and renamed it Aurangabad. <br> Aurangabad is sometimes referred to as Khujista Bunyad by the Chroniclers of Aurangzeb's reign.
